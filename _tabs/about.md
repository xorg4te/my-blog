Hi ðŸ‘‹ and **welcome to my blog** ! I'll let you browse this page to find out **a little** more about me.

Let me introduce myself, **xor**. Quick introduction I grant you. It's due to the fact that I don't want to divulge my identity to anyone.

Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, I'm just one of many *computer enthusiasts*. On this blog, you'll find posts on a variety of subjects, all related to computing. These can range from simple **challenge solving** to **complex explanations**. You can contact me via my __social networks__ and ask me any questions you may have.

As for my skills, I'd rather not say anything at the moment. You'll be able to get your own idea of what I know once you've read my first posts. Don't get me wrong, I just can't judge myself.

Do you know where my nickname comes from? If you don't, I'll let you [click here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), it'll help you understand ðŸ˜‰. See you soon! 

Sincerely, xor.
