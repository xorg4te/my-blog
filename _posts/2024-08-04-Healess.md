Hi everyone, today we're going to take a look at how to exploit a [Linux server](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/linux-server), by exploring a number of well-known vulnerabilities, both now and in the past. You can even find some of them in the [OWASP top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).

Well, first let's see if the host machine is alive :

```bash
ping -c 3 10.10.11.8
```

This command will send [echo requests](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/internet-core-protocols/1565925726/re56.html) to the host machine ( with [type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol) initialized to 8 and [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol) set to 0 ). If the machine returns an [echo reply](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/internet-core-protocols/1565925726/re56.html), this means that the machine is up ( with [type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol) set to 0 and [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol) set to 0 ).

```bash
PING 10.10.11.8 (10.10.11.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.10.11.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=51.7 ms

64 bytes from 10.10.11.8: icmp_seq=3 ttl=63 time=41.8 ms

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 29.146/40.895/51.713/9.236 ms
```

Well, we've received an [echo reply](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/internet-core-protocols/1565925726/re56.html), which means the machine is up.
