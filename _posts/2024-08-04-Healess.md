Hi everyone, today we're going to take a look at how to exploit a [Linux server](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/linux-server), by exploring a number of well-known vulnerabilities, both now and in the past. You can even find some of them in the [OWASP top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).

Well, first let's see if the host machine is alive :

```bash
ping -c 3 10.10.11.8
```

This command will send [echo requests](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/internet-core-protocols/1565925726/re56.html) to the host machine ( with [type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol) initialized to 8 and [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol) set to 0 ). If the machine returns an [echo reply](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/internet-core-protocols/1565925726/re56.html), this means that the machine is up ( with [type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol) set to 0 and [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol) set to 0 ).

```bash

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 29.146/40.895/51.713/9.236 ms
```

Well, we've received an [echo reply](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/internet-core-protocols/1565925726/re56.html), which means the machine is up.

Now we can scan the machine's [open ports](https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/what-is-an-open-port-what-are-the-security-implications). To start with, we're going to use a simple method, a port scan with the `-sS` flag ( [SYN Stealth scan](https://nmap.org/book/synscan.html) ) nmap as root, does this by default, which is designed to perform a discrete scan on a machine. Having specified nothing else, nmap will scan the **1000 most common ports** :

```bash
nmap -sS 10.10.11.8
```

It didn't take long, but here's the result of our first scan :

```bash
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-08-04 13:12 CEST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.8
Host is up (0.064s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
5000/tcp open  upnp

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.91 seconds
```
